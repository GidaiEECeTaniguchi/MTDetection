{"en": "So she was an old woman by this time.", "ja": "だから婆（ばあ）さんである。"}
{"en": "This old woman,--by what affinity, as the Buddhists say, I don't know,--loved me a great deal.", "ja": "この婆さんがどういう因縁（いんえん）か、おれを非常に可愛がってくれた。"}
{"en": "Strange, indeed!", "ja": "不思議なものである。"}
{"en": "She was almost blindly fond of me,--me, whom mother, became thoroughly disgusted with three days before her death;", "ja": "母も死ぬ三日前に愛想（あいそ）をつかした"}
{"en": "whom father considered a most aggravating proposition all the year round, and whom the neighbors cordially hated as the local bully among the youngsters.", "ja": "――おやじも年中持て余している"}

{"en": "so I thought it uncommon that Kiyo should pet me like that.", "ja": "かえってこの清のようにちやほやしてくれるのを不審（ふしん）に考えた。"}
{"en": "Sometimes in the kitchen, when there was nobody around, she would praise me saying that I was straightforward and of a good disposition.", "ja": "清は時々台所で人の居ない時に"}
{"en": "What she meant by that exactly, was not clear to me, however.", "ja": "しかしおれには清の云う意味が分からなかった。"}
{"en": "If I were of so good a nature as she said, I imagined those other than Kiyo should accord me a better treatment.", "ja": "好（い）い気性なら清以外のものも、もう少し善くしてくれるだろうと思った。"}
{"en": "So whenever Kiyo said to me anything of the kind, I used to answer that I did not like passing compliments.", "ja": "清がこんな事を云う度におれはお世辞は嫌（きら）いだと答えるのが常であった。"}
{"en": "Then she would remark; \"That's the very reason I say you are of a good disposition,\"", "ja": "すると婆さんはそれだから好いご気性ですと云っては、"}
{"en": "and would gaze at me with absorbing tenderness.", "ja": "嬉しそうにおれの顔を眺（なが）めている。"}
{"en": "She seemed to recreate me by her own imagination, and was proud of the fact.", "ja": "自分の力でおれを製造して誇（ほこ）ってるように見える。"}
{"en": "I felt even chilled through my marrow at her constant attention to me.", "ja": "少々気味がわるかった。"}
{"en": "After my mother was dead, Kiyo loved me still more.", "ja": "母が死んでから清はいよいよおれを可愛がった。"}
{"en": "In my simple reasoning, I wondered why she had taken such a fancy to me.", "ja": "時々は小供心になぜあんなに可愛がるのかと不審に思った。"}
{"en": "Sometimes I thought it quite futile on her part, that she had better quit that sort of thing,", "ja": "つまらない、廃（よ）せばいいのにと思った。"}
{"en": "which was bad for her.", "ja": "気の毒だと思った。"}
{"en": "But she loved me just the same.", "ja": "それでも清は可愛がる。"}
{"en": "Once in, a while she would buy, out of her own pocket, some cakes or sweetmeats for me.", "ja": "折々は自分の小遣（こづか）いで金鍔（きんつば）や紅梅焼（こうばいやき）を買ってくれる。"}
{"en": "When the night was cold, she would secretly buy some noodle powder, and bring all unawares hot noodle gruel to my bed;", "ja": "寒い夜などはひそかに蕎麦粉（そばこ）を仕入れておいて、いつの間にか寝（ね）ている枕元（まくらもと）へ蕎麦湯を持って来てくれる。"}
{"en": "or sometimes she would even buy a bowl of steaming noodles from the peddler.", "ja": "時には鍋焼饂飩（なべやきうどん）さえ買ってくれた。"}
{"en": "Not only with edibles,", "ja": "ただ食い物ばかりではない。"}
{"en": "but she was generous alike with socks,", "ja": "靴足袋（くつたび）ももらった。"}
{"en": "pencils, note books, etc.", "ja": "鉛筆（えんぴつ）も貰った、帳面も貰った。"}
{"en": "And she even furnished me,--this happened some time later,--with about three yen,", "ja": "これはずっと後の事であるが金を三円ばかり貸してくれた事さえある。"}
{"en": "I did not ask her for the money;", "ja": "何も貸せと云った訳ではない。"}
{"en": "she offered it from her own good will by bringing it to my room, saying that I might be in need of some cash.", "ja": "向うで部屋へ持って来てお小遣いがなくてお困りでしょう、お使いなさいと云ってくれたんだ。"}
{"en": "This, of course, embarrassed me, but as she was so insistent I consented to borrow it.", "ja": "おれは無論入らないと云ったが、是非使えと云うから、借りておいた。"}
{"en": "I confess I was really glad of the money.", "ja": "実は大変嬉しかった。"}
{"en": "I put it in a bag, and carried it in my pocket.", "ja": "その三円を蝦蟇口（がまぐち）へ入れて、懐（ふところ）へ入れたなり"}
{"en": "While about the house, I happened to drop the bag into a cesspool.", "ja": "便所へ行ったら、すぽりと後架（こうか）の中へ落（おと）してしまった。"}
{"en": "Helpless, I told Kiyo how I had lost the money, and at once she fetched a bamboo stick, and said she will get it for me.", "ja": "仕方がないから、のそのそ出てきて実はこれこれだと清に話したところが、清は早速竹の棒を捜（さが）して来て、取って上げますと云った。"}
{"en": "After a while I heard a splashing sound of water about our family well, and going there, saw Kiyo washing the bag strung on the end of the stick.", "ja": "しばらくすると井戸端（いどばた）でざあざあ音がするから、出てみたら竹の先へ蝦蟇口の紐（ひも）を引き懸（か）けたのを水で洗っていた。"}
{"en": "I opened the bag and found the edict of the three one-yen bills turned to faint yellow and designs fading.", "ja": "それから口をあけて壱円札（いちえんさつ）を改めたら茶色になって模様が消えかかっていた。"}
{"en": "Kiyo dried them at an open fire and handed them over to me, asking if they were all right.", "ja": "清は火鉢で乾（かわ）かして、これでいいでしょうと出した。"}
{"en": "I smelled them and said; \"They stink yet.\"", "ja": "ちょっとかいでみて臭（くさ）いやと云ったら、"}
{"en": "\"Give them to me;", "ja": "それじゃお出しなさい、"}
{"en": "I'll get them changed.\"", "ja": "取り換（か）えて来て上げますからと、"}
{"en": "She took those three bills, and,--I do not know how she went about it,--brought three yen in silver.", "ja": "どこでどう胡魔化（ごまか）したか札の代りに銀貨を三円持って来た。"}
{"en": "I forget now upon what I spent the three yen.", "ja": "この三円は何に使ったか忘れてしまった。"}
{"en": "\"I'll pay you back soon,\" I said at the time, but didn't.", "ja": "今に返すよと云ったぎり、返さない。"}
{"en": "I could not now pay it back even if I wished to do so with ten times the amount.", "ja": "今となっては十倍にして返してやりたくても返せない。"}
{"en": "When Kiyo gave me anything she did so always when both father and brother were out.", "ja": "清が物をくれる時には必ずおやじも兄も居ない時に限る。"}
{"en": "Many things I do not like, but what I most detest is the monopolizing of favors behind some one else's back.", "ja": "おれは何が嫌いだと云って人に隠れて自分だけ得をするほど嫌いな事はない。"}
{"en": "Bad as my relations were with my brother, still I did not feel justified in accepting candies or color-pencils from Kiyo without my brother's knowledge.", "ja": "兄とは無論仲がよくないけれども、兄に隠して清から菓子（かし）や色鉛筆を貰いたくはない。"}
{"en": "\"Why do you give those things only to me and not to my brother also?\" I asked her once,", "ja": "なぜ、おれ一人にくれて、兄さんには遣（や）らないのかと清に聞く事がある。"}
{"en": "and she answered quite unconcernedly that my brother may be left to himself as his father bought him everything.", "ja": "すると清は澄（すま）したものでお兄様（あにいさま）はお父様（とうさま）が買ってお上げなさるから構いませんと云う。"}
{"en": "That was partiality;", "ja": "これは不公平である。"}
{"en": "father was obstinate, but I am sure he was not a man who would indulge in favoritism.", "ja": "おやじは頑固（がんこ）だけれども、そんな依怙贔負（えこひいき）はせぬ男だ。"}
{"en": "To Kiyo, however, he might have looked that way.", "ja": "しかし清の眼から見るとそう見えるのだろう。"}
{"en": "There is no doubt that Kiyo was blind to the extent of her undue indulgence with me.", "ja": "全く愛に溺（おぼ）れていたに違（ちが）いない。"}
{"en": "She was said to have come from a well-to-do family, but the poor soul was uneducated, and it could not be helped.", "ja": "元は身分のあるものでも教育のない婆さんだから仕方がない。"}
{"en": "All the same,", "ja": "単にこればかりではない。"}
{"en": "you cannot tell how prejudice will drive one to the extremes.", "ja": "贔負目は恐ろしいものだ。"}
{"en": "Kiyo seemed quite sure that some day I would achieve high position in society and become famous.", "ja": "清はおれをもって将来立身出世して立派なものになると思い込んでいた。"}
{"en": "Equally she was sure that my brother, who was spending his hours studiously, was only good for his white skin, and would stand no show in the future.", "ja": "その癖勉強をする兄は色ばかり白くって、とても役には立たないと一人できめてしまった。"}
{"en": "Nothing can beat an old woman for this sort of thing, I tell you.", "ja": "こんな婆さんに逢（あ）っては叶（かな）わない。"}
{"en": "She firmly believed that whoever she liked would become famous, while whoever she hated would not.", "ja": "自分の好きなものは必ずえらい人物になって、嫌いなひとはきっと落ち振れるものと信じている。"}
{"en": "I did not have at that time any particular object in my life.", "ja": "おれはその時から別段何になると云う了見（りょうけん）もなかった。"}
{"en": "But the persistency with which Kiyo declared that I would be a great man some day, made me speculate myself that after all I might become one.", "ja": "しかし清がなるなると云うものだから、やっぱり何かに成れるんだろうと思っていた。"}
{"en": "How absurd it seems to me now when I recall those days.", "ja": "今から考えると馬鹿馬鹿（ばかばか）しい。"}
{"en": "I asked her once what kind of a man I should be,", "ja": "ある時などは清にどんなものになるだろうと聞いてみた事がある。"}
{"en": "but she seemed to have formed no concrete idea as to that;", "ja": "ところが清にも別段の考えもなかったようだ。"}
{"en": "only she said that I was sure to live in a house with grand entrance hall, and ride in a private rikisha.", "ja": "ただ手車（てぐるま）へ乗って、立派な玄関（げんかん）のある家をこしらえるに相違（そうい）ないと云った。"}
{"en": "And Kiyo seemed to have decided for herself to live with me when I became independent and occupy my own house.", "ja": "それから清はおれがうちでも持って独立したら、一所（いっしょ）になる気でいた。"}
{"en": "\"Please let me live with you,\" --she repeatedly asked of me.", "ja": "どうか置いて下さいと何遍も繰（く）り返して頼んだ。"}
{"en": "Feeling somewhat that I should eventually be able to own a house, I answered her \"Yes,\" as far as such an answer went.", "ja": "おれも何だかうちが持てるような気がして、うん置いてやると返事だけはしておいた。"}
{"en": "This woman, by the way, was strongly imaginative.", "ja": "ところがこの女はなかなか想像の強い女で、"}
{"en": "She questioned me what place I liked,--Kojimachi-ku or Azabu-ku?--and suggested that I should have a swing in our garden, that one room be enough for European style, etc., planning everything to suit her own fancy.", "ja": "あなたはどこがお好き、麹町（こうじまち）ですか麻布（あざぶ）ですか、お庭へぶらんこをおこしらえ遊ばせ、西洋間は一つでたくさんですなどと勝手な計画を独りで並（なら）べていた。"}
{"en": "I did not then care a straw for anything like a house;", "ja": "その時は家なんか欲しくも何ともなかった。"}
{"en": "so neither Japanese nor European style was much of use to me, and I told her to that effect.", "ja": "西洋館も日本建（にほんだて）も全く不用であったから、そんなものは欲しくないと、いつでも清に答えた。"}
{"en": "Then she would praise me as uncovetous and clean of heart.", "ja": "すると、あなたは欲がすくなくって、心が奇麗だと云ってまた賞めた。"}
{"en": "Whatever I said, she had praise for me.", "ja": "清は何と云っても賞めてくれる。"}
{"en": "I lived, after the death of mother, in this fashion for five or six years.", "ja": "母が死んでから五六年の間はこの状態で暮していた。"}
{"en": "I had kicks from father,", "ja": "おやじには叱られる。"}
{"en": "had rows with brother,", "ja": "兄とは喧嘩をする。"}
{"en": "and had candies and praise from Kiyo.", "ja": "清には菓子を貰う、時々賞められる。"}
{"en": "I cared for nothing more;", "ja": "別に望みもない。"}
{"en": "I thought this was enough.", "ja": "これでたくさんだと思っていた。"}
{"en": "I imagined all other boys were leading about the same kind of life.", "ja": "ほかの小供も一概（いちがい）にこんなものだろうと思っていた。"}
{"en": "As Kiyo frequently told me, however, that I was to be pitied, and was unfortunate, I imagined that that might be so.", "ja": "ただ清が何かにつけて、あなたはお可哀想（かわいそう）だ、不仕合（ふしあわせ）だと無暗に云うものだから、それじゃ可哀想で不仕合せなんだろうと思った。"}

{"en": "The talk on business over, Porcupine said that he did not think it was my intention to stay in such a hotel all the time, that he would find a room for me in a good boarding house, and that I should move.", "ja": "授業上の打ち合せが済んだら、君はいつまでこんな宿屋に居るつもりでもあるまい、僕（ぼく）がいい下宿を周旋（しゅうせん）してやるから移りたまえ。"}
{"en": "\"They wouldn't take in another from anybody else but I can do it right away.", "ja": "外のものでは承知しないが僕が話せばすぐ出来る。"}
{"en": "The sooner the better. Go and look at the room to-day, move tomorrow and start teaching from the next day. That'll be all nice and settled.\" He seemed satisfied by arranging all by himself.", "ja": "早い方がいいから、今日見て、あす移って、あさってから学校へ行けば極りがいいと一人で呑み込んでいる。"}
{"en": "Indeed, I should not be able to occupy such a room for long.", "ja": "なるほど十五畳敷にいつまで居る訳にも行くまい。"}
{"en": "I might have to blow in all of my salary for the hotel bill and yet be short of squaring it.", "ja": "月給をみんな宿料（しゅくりょう）に払（はら）っても追っつかないかもしれぬ。"}
{"en": "It was pity to leave the hotel so soon after I had just shone with a 5-yen tip.", "ja": "五円の茶代を奮発（ふんぱつ）してすぐ移るのはちと残念だが、"}
{"en": "However, it being decidedly convenient to move and get settled early if I had to move at all, I asked Porcupine to get that room for me.", "ja": "どうせ移る者なら、早く引き越（こ）して落ち付く方が便利だから、そこのところはよろしく山嵐に頼（たの）む事にした。"}
{"en": "He told me then to come over with him and see the house at any rate, and I did.", "ja": "すると山嵐はともかくもいっしょに来てみろと云うから、行った。"}
{"en": "The house was situated mid-way up a hill at the end of the town, and was a quiet.", "ja": "町はずれの岡の中腹にある家で至極閑静（かんせい）だ。"}
{"en": "The boss was said to be a dealer in antique curios, called Ikagin, and his wife was about four years his senior.", "ja": "主人は骨董（こっとう）を売買するいか銀と云う男で、女房（にょうぼう）は亭主（ていしゅ）よりも四つばかり年嵩（としかさ）の女だ。"}
{"en": "I learned the English word \"witch\" when I was in middle school, and this woman looked exactly like one.", "ja": "中学校に居た時ウィッチと云う言葉を習った事があるがこの女房はまさにウィッチに似ている。"}

{"en": "Finally I decided to live in the house from the next day.", "ja": "とうとう明日から引き移る事にした。"}
{"en": "On our way back Porcupine treated me to a cup of ice-water.", "ja": "帰りに山嵐は通町（とおりちょう）で氷水を一杯奢（ぱいおご）った。"}
{"en": "When I first met him in the school, I thought him a disgustingly overbearing fellow, but judging by the way he had looked after me so far, he appeared not so bad after all.", "ja": "学校で逢った時はやに横風（おうふう）な失敬な奴だと思ったが、こんなにいろいろ世話をしてくれるところを見ると、わるい男でもなさそうだ。"}
{"en": "Only he seemed, like me, impatient by nature and of quick-temper.", "ja": "ただおれと同じようにせっかちで肝癪持（かんしゃくもち）らしい。"}
{"en": "I heard afterward that he was liked most by all the students in the school.", "ja": "あとで聞いたらこの男が一番生徒に人望があるのだそうだ。"}
{"en": "My teaching began at last.", "ja": "いよいよ学校へ出た。"}
{"en": "When I entered the class-room and stepped upon the platform for the first time, I felt somewhat strange.", "ja": "初めて教場へはいって高い所へ乗った時は、何だか変だった。"}
{"en": "While lecturing, I wondered if a fellow like me could keep up the profession of public instructor.", "ja": "講釈をしながら、おれでも先生が勤まるのかと思った。"}
{"en": "The students were noisy.", "ja": "生徒はやかましい。"}
{"en": "Once in a while, they would holler \"Teacher!\" \"Teacher,\" --it was \"going some.\"", "ja": "時々図抜（ずぬ）けた大きな声で先生と云（い）う。"}
{"en": "I had been calling others \"teacher\" every day so far, in the school of physics, but in calling others \"teacher\" and being called one, there is a wide gap of difference.", "ja": "先生には応（こた）えた。"}

{"en": "only--it's a pity--I lack audacity.", "ja": "臆病（おくびょう）な男でもないが、惜（お）しい事に胆力（たんりょく）が欠けている。"}
{"en": "If one calls me \"teacher\" aloud, it gives me a shock similar to that of hearing the noon-gun in Marunouchi when I was hungry.", "ja": "先生と大きな声をされると、腹の減った時に丸の内で午砲（どん）を聞いたような気がする。"}
{"en": "The first hour passed away in a dashing manner.", "ja": "最初の一時間は何だかいい加減にやってしまった。"}
{"en": "And it passed away without encountering any knotty questions.", "ja": "しかし別段困った質問も掛（か）けられずに済んだ。"}
{"en": "As I returned to the teachers' room, Porcupine asked me how it was.", "ja": "控所（ひかえじょ）へ帰って来たら、山嵐がどうだいと聞いた。"}
{"en": "I simply answered \"well,\" and he seemed satisfied.", "ja": "うんと単簡に返事をしたら山嵐は安心したらしかった。"}
{"en": "When I left the teachers' room, chalk in hand, for the second hour class, I felt as if I was invading the enemy's territory.", "ja": "二時間目に白墨（はくぼく）を持って控所を出た時には何だか敵地へ乗り込（こ）むような気がした。"}
{"en": "On entering the room, I found the students for this hour were all big fellows.", "ja": "教場へ出ると今度の組は前より大きな奴（やつ）ばかりである。"}
{"en": "I am a Tokyo kid, delicately built and small, and did not appear very impressive even in my elevated position.", "ja": "おれは江戸（えど）っ子で華奢（きゃしゃ）に小作りに出来ているから、どうも高い所へ上がっても押（お）しが利かない。"}
{"en": "If it comes to a scraping, I can hold my own even with wrestlers, but I had no means of appearing awe-inspiring[E], merely by the aid of my tongue, to so many as forty such big chaps before me.", "ja": "喧嘩（けんか）なら相撲取（すもうとり）とでもやってみせるが、こんな大僧（おおぞう）を四十人も前へ並（なら）べて、ただ一枚（まい）の舌をたたいて恐縮（きょうしゅく）させる手際はない。"}
{"en": "Believing, however, that it would set a bad precedent to show these country fellows any weakness, I lectured rather loudly and in brusque tone.", "ja": "しかしこんな田舎者（いなかもの）に弱身を見せると癖（くせ）になると思ったから、なるべく大きな声をして、少々巻き舌で講釈してやった。"}
{"en": "During the first part the students were taken aback and listened literally with their mouths open.", "ja": "最初のうちは、生徒も烟（けむ）に捲（ま）かれてぼんやりしていたから、"}
{"en": "\"That's one on you!\" I thought. Elated by my success, I kept on in this tone, when one who looked the strongest, sitting in the middle of the front row, stood up suddenly, and called \"Teacher!\"", "ja": "それ見ろとますます得意になって、べらんめい調を用いてたら、一番前の列の真中（まんなか）に居た、一番強そうな奴が、いきなり起立して先生と云う。"}
{"en": "There it goes!--I thought, and asked him what it was.", "ja": "そら来たと思いながら、何だと聞いたら、"}
{"en": "\"A-ah sa-ay, you talk too quick.", "ja": "「あまり早くて分からんけれ、"}
{"en": "A-ah ca-an't you make it a leetle slow?", "ja": "もちっと、ゆるゆる遣（や）って、おくれんかな、"}
{"en": "A-ah?\"", "ja": "もし」"}
{"en": "\"A-ah ca-an't you?\" \"A-ah?\" was altogether dull.", "ja": "おくれんかな、もしは生温（なまぬ）るい言葉だ。"}
{"en": "\"If I talk too fast, I'll make it slow, but I'm a Tokyo fellow, and can't talk the way you do.", "ja": "早過ぎるなら、ゆっくり云ってやるが、おれは江戸っ子だから君等（きみら）の言葉は使えない、"}
{"en": "If you don't understand it, better wait until you do.\" So I answered him.", "ja": "分（わか）らなければ、分るまで待ってるがいいと答えてやった。"}
{"en": "In this way the second hour was closed better than I had expected.", "ja": "この調子で二時間目は思ったより、うまく行った。"}
{"en": "Only, as I was about to leave the class, one of the students asked me, \"A-ah say, won't you please do them for me?\" and showed me some problems in geometry which I was sure I could not solve. This proved to be somewhat a damper on me.", "ja": "ただ帰りがけに生徒の一人がちょっとこの問題を解釈をしておくれんかな、もし、と出来そうもない幾何（きか）の問題を持って逼（せま）ったには冷汗（ひやあせ）を流した。"}
{"en": "But, helpless, I told him I could not make them out, and telling him that I would show him how next time, hastily got out of the room.", "ja": "仕方がないから何だか分らない、この次教えてやると急いで引き揚（あ）げたら、"}
{"en": "And all of them raised \"Whee--ee!\"", "ja": "生徒がわあと囃（はや）した。"}
{"en": "Some of them were heard saying \"He doesn't know much.\"", "ja": "その中に出来ん出来んと云う声が聞（きこ）える。"}
{"en": "Don't take a teacher for an encyclopaedia!", "ja": "箆棒（べらぼう）め、先生だって、出来ないのは当り前だ。"}
{"en": "If I could work out such hard questions as these easily, I would not be in such a backwoods town for forty yen a month. I returned to the teachers' room.", "ja": "そんなものが出来るくらいなら四十円でこんな田舎へくるもんかと控所へ帰って来た。"}
{"en": "\"How was it this time?\" asked Porcupine.", "ja": "今度はどうだとまた山嵐が聞いた。"}
{"en": "I said \"Umh.\"", "ja": "うんと云ったが、"}
{"en": "But not satisfied with \"Umh\" only, I added that all the students in this school were boneheads.", "ja": "うんだけでは気が済まなかったから、この学校の生徒は分らずやだなと云ってやった。"}
{"en": "He put up a whimsical face.", "ja": "山嵐は妙（みょう）な顔をしていた。"}
{"en": "The third and the fourth hour and the first hour in the afternoon were more or less the same.", "ja": "三時間目も、四時間目も昼過ぎの一時間も大同小異であった。"}
{"en": "In all the classes I attended, I made some kind of blunder.", "ja": "最初の日に出た級は、いずれも少々ずつ失敗した。"}
{"en": "I realised that the profession of teaching not quite so easy a calling as might have appeared.", "ja": "教師ははたで見るほど楽じゃないと思った。"}
{"en": "My teaching for the day was finished but I could not get away.", "ja": "授業はひと通り済んだが、まだ帰れない、"}
{"en": "I had to wait alone until three o'clock.", "ja": "三時までぽつ然（ねん）として待ってなくてはならん。"}
{"en": "I understood that at three o'clock the students of my classes would finish cleaning up the rooms and report to me, whereupon I would go over the rooms.", "ja": "三時になると、受持級の生徒が自分の教室を掃除（そうじ）して報知（しらせ）にくるから検分をするんだそうだ。"}
{"en": "Then I would run through the students' roll, and then be free to go home.", "ja": "それから、出席簿（しゅっせきぼ）を一応調べてようやくお暇（ひま）が出る。"}
{"en": "Outrageous, indeed, to keep on chained to the school, staring at the empty space when he had nothing more to do, even though he was \"bought\" by a salary!", "ja": "いくら月給で買われた身体（からだ）だって、あいた時間まで学校へ縛（しば）りつけて机と睨（にら）めっくらをさせるなんて法があるものか。"}
{"en": "Other fellow teachers, however, meekly submitted to the regulation, and believing it not well for me,--a new comer--to fuss about it, I stood it.", "ja": "しかしほかの連中はみんな大人（おとな）しくご規則通りやってるから新参のおればかり、だだを捏（こ）ねるのもよろしくないと思って我慢（がまん）していた。"}
{"en": "On my way home, I appealed to Porcupine as to the absurdity of keeping me there till three o'clock regardless of my having nothing to do in the school.", "ja": "帰りがけに、君何でもかんでも三時過（すぎ）まで学校にいさせるのは愚（おろか）だぜと山嵐に訴えたら、"}
{"en": "He said \"Yes\" and laughed.", "ja": "山嵐はそうさアハハハと笑ったが、"}
{"en": "But he became serious and in an advisory manner told me not to make many complaints about the school.", "ja": "あとから真面目（まじめ）になって、君あまり学校の不平を云うと、いかんぜ。"}
{"en": "\"Talk to me only, if you want to.", "ja": "云うなら僕（ぼく）だけに話せ、"}
{"en": "There are some queer guys around.\"", "ja": "随分（ずいぶん）妙な人も居るからなと忠告がましい事を云った。"}
{"en": "As we parted at the next corner, I did not have time to hear more from him.", "ja": "四つ角で分れたから詳（くわ）しい事は聞くひまがなかった。"}
{"en": "On reaching my room, the boss of the house came to me saying, \"Let me serve you tea.\"", "ja": "それからうちへ帰ってくると、宿の亭主（ていしゅ）がお茶を入れましょうと云ってやって来る。"}
{"en": "I expected he was going to treat me to some good tea since he said \"Let me serve you,\" but he simply made himself at home and drank my own tea.", "ja": "お茶を入れると云うからご馳走（ちそう）をするのかと思うと、おれの茶を遠慮（えんりょ）なく入れて自分が飲むのだ。"}
{"en": "Judging by this, I thought he might be practising \"Let me serve you\" during my absence.", "ja": "この様子では留守中（るすちゅう）も勝手にお茶を入れましょうを一人（ひとり）で履行（りこう）しているかも知れない。"}
{"en": "The boss said that he was fond of antique drawings and curios and finally had decided to start in that business.", "ja": "亭主が云うには手前は書画骨董（しょがこっとう）がすきで、とうとうこんな商買を内々で始めるようになりました。"}
{"en": "\"You look like one quite taken about art.", "ja": "あなたもお見受け申すところ大分ご風流でいらっしゃるらしい。"}

{"en": "I have been mistaken on many occasions for as many things, but none so far has counted on me as a probable connoisseur of art.", "ja": "その外今日（こんにち）まで見損（みそくな）われた事は随分あるが、まだおれをつらまえて大分ご風流でいらっしゃると云ったものはない。"}
{"en": "One should know better by my appearance.", "ja": "大抵（たいてい）はなりや様子でも分る。"}
{"en": "Any one who aspires to be a patron of art is usually pictured,--you may see in any drawing,--with either a hood on his head, or carrying a tanzaku[3] in his hand.", "ja": "風流人なんていうものは、画（え）を見ても、頭巾（ずきん）を被（かぶ）るか短冊（たんざく）を持ってるものだ。"}
{"en": "The fellow who calls me a connoisseur of art and pretends to mean it, may be surely as crooked as a dog's hind legs.", "ja": "このおれを風流人だなどと真面目に云うのはただの曲者（くせもの）じゃない。"}
{"en": "I told him I did not like such art-stuff, which is usually favored by retired people.", "ja": "おれはそんな呑気（のんき）な隠居（いんきょ）のやるような事は嫌（きら）いだと云ったら、"}
{"en": "He laughed, and remarking that that nobody liked it at first, but once in it, will find it so fascinating that he will hardly get over it, served tea for himself and drank it in a grotesque manner.", "ja": "亭主はへへへへと笑いながら、いえ始めから好きなものは、どなたもございませんが、いったんこの道にはいるとなかなか出られませんと一人で茶を注いで妙な手付（てつき）をして飲んでいる。"}
{"en": "I may say that I had asked him the night before to buy some tea for me, but I did not like such a bitter, heavy kind.", "ja": "実はゆうべ茶を買ってくれと頼（たの）んでおいたのだが、こんな苦い濃（こ）い茶はいやだ。"}
{"en": "One swallow seemed to act right on my stomach.", "ja": "一杯（ぱい）飲むと胃に答えるような気がする。"}
{"en": "I told him to buy a kind not so bitter as that, and he answered \"All right, Sir,\" and drank another cup.", "ja": "今度からもっと苦くないのを買ってくれと云ったら、かしこまりましたとまた一杯しぼって飲んだ。"}
{"en": "The fellow seemed never to know of having enough of anything so long as it was another man's.", "ja": "人の茶だと思って無暗（むやみ）に飲む奴（やつ）だ。"}
{"en": "After he left the room, I prepared for the morrow and went to bed.", "ja": "主人が引き下がってから、明日の下読（したよみ）をしてすぐ寝（ね）てしまった。"}
{"en": "Everyday thereafter I attended at the school and worked as per regulations.", "ja": "それから毎日毎日学校へ出ては規則通り働く、"}
{"en": "Every day on my return, the boss came to my room with the same old \"Let me serve you tea.\"", "ja": "毎日毎日帰って来ると主人がお茶を入れましょうと出てくる。"}
{"en": "In about a week I understood the school in a general way, and had my own idea as to the personality of the boss and his wife.", "ja": "一週間ばかりしたら学校の様子もひと通りは飲み込めたし、宿の夫婦の人物も大概（たいがい）は分った。"}
{"en": "I heard from one of my fellow teachers that the first week to one month after the receipt of the appointment worried them most as to whether they had been favorably received among the students.", "ja": "ほかの教師に聞いてみると辞令を受けて一週間から一ヶ月ぐらいの間は自分の評判がいいだろうか、悪（わ）るいだろうか非常に気に掛（か）かるそうであるが、"}
{"en": "I never felt anything on that score.", "ja": "おれは一向そんな感じはなかった。"}
{"en": "Blunders in the class room once in a while caused me chagrin, but in about half an hour everything would clear out of my head.", "ja": "教場で折々しくじるとその時だけはやな心持ちだが三十分ばかり立つと奇麗（きれい）に消えてしまう。"}
{"en": "I am a fellow who, by nature, can't be worrying long about[F] anything even if I try to.", "ja": "おれは何事によらず長く心配しようと思っても心配が出来ない男だ。"}
{"en": "I was absolutely indifferent as how my blunders in the class room affected the students, or how much further they affected the principal or the head-teacher.", "ja": "教場のしくじりが生徒にどんな影響（えいきょう）を与（あた）えて、その影響が校長や教頭にどんな反応を呈（てい）するかまるで無頓着（むとんじゃく）であった。"}
{"en": "As I mentioned before, I am not a fellow of much audacity to speak of, but I am quick to give up anything when I see its finish.", "ja": "おれは前に云う通りあまり度胸の据（すわ）った男ではないのだが、思い切りはすこぶるいい人間である。"}
{"en": "I had resolved to go elsewhere at once if the school did not suit me.", "ja": "この学校がいけなければすぐどっかへ行（ゆ）く覚悟（かくご）でいたから、"}
{"en": "In consequence, neither Badger nor Red Shirt wielded any influence over me.", "ja": "狸（たぬき）も赤シャツも、ちっとも恐（おそろ）しくはなかった。"}
{"en": "And still less did I feel like coaxing or coddling the youngsters in the class room.", "ja": "まして教場の小僧（こぞう）共なんかには愛嬌（あいきょう）もお世辞も使う気になれなかった。"}
{"en": "So far it was O.K. with the school, but not so easy as that at my boarding house.", "ja": "学校はそれでいいのだが下宿の方はそうはいかなかった。"}
{"en": "I could have stood it if it had been only the boss coming to my room after my tea.", "ja": "亭主が茶を飲みに来るだけなら我慢もするが、"}
{"en": "But he would fetch many things to my room.", "ja": "いろいろな者を持ってくる。"}
{"en": "First time he brought in seals.[4]", "ja": "始めに持って来たのは何でも印材で、"}
{"en": "He displayed about ten of them before me and persuaded me to buy them for three yen, which was very cheap, he said.", "ja": "十（とお）ばかり並（なら）べておいて、みんなで三円なら安い物だお買いなさいと云う。"}
{"en": "Did he take me for a third rate painter making a round of the country?", "ja": "田舎巡（いなかまわ）りのヘボ絵師じゃあるまいし、"}
{"en": "I told him I did not want them.", "ja": "そんなものは入らないと云ったら、"}
{"en": "Next time he brought in a panel picture of flowers and birds, drawn by one Kazan or somebody.", "ja": "今度は華山（かざん）とか何とか云う男の花鳥の掛物（かけもの）をもって来た。"}
{"en": "He hung it against the wall of the alcove and asked me if it was not well done, and I echoed it looked well done.", "ja": "自分で床（とこ）の間（ま）へかけて、いい出来じゃありませんかと云うから、そうかなと好加減（いいかげん）に挨拶（あいさつ）をすると、"}
{"en": "Then he started lecturing about Kazan, that there are two Kazans, one is Kazan something and the other is Kazan anything, and that this picture was the work of that Kazan something.", "ja": "華山には二人（ふたり）ある、一人は何とか華山で、一人は何とか華山ですが、この幅（ふく）はその何とか華山の方だと、"}
{"en": "After this nonsensical lecture, he insisted that he would make it fifteen yen for me to buy it.", "ja": "くだらない講釈をしたあとで、どうです、あなたなら十五円にしておきます。"}
{"en": "I declined the offer saying that I was shy of the money.", "ja": "金がないと断わると、"}
{"en": "\"You can pay any time.\" He was insistent.", "ja": "金なんか、いつでもようございますとなかなか頑固（がんこ）だ。"}
{"en": "I settled him by telling him of my having no intention of purchasing it even if I had the necessary money.", "ja": "金があつても買わないんだと、その時は追っ払（ぱら）っちまった。"}
{"en": "Again next time, he yanked in a big writing stone slab about the size of a ridge-tile.", "ja": "その次には鬼瓦（おにがわら）ぐらいな大硯（おおすずり）を担ぎ込んだ。"}
{"en": "\"This is a tankei,\"[5] he said.", "ja": "これは端渓（たんけい）です、"}
{"en": "As he \"tankeied\" two or three times, I asked for fun what was a tankei.", "ja": "端渓ですと二遍（へん）も三遍も端渓がるから、面白半分に端渓た何だいと聞いたら、"}
{"en": "Right away he commenced lecturing on the subject.", "ja": "すぐ講釈を始め出した。"}
{"en": "\"There are the upper, the middle and the lower stratum in tankei,\" he said.", "ja": "端渓には上層中層下層とあって、"}
{"en": "\"Most of tankei slabs to-day are made from the upper stratum,\" he continued,", "ja": "今時のものはみんな上層ですが、"}
{"en": "\"but this one is surely from the middle stratum.", "ja": "これはたしかに中層です、"}

{"en": "Try it, sir,\"", "ja": "試してご覧なさいと、"}
{"en": "--and he pushed it towards me.", "ja": "おれの前へ大きな硯を突（つ）きつける。"}
{"en": "I asked him how much, and he answered that on account of its owner having brought it from China and wishing to sell if as soon as possible, he would make it very cheap, that I could have it for thirty yen.", "ja": "いくらだと聞くと、持主が支那（しな）から持って帰って来て是非売りたいと云いますから、お安くして三十円にしておきましょうと云う。"}
{"en": "I was sure he was a fool.", "ja": "この男は馬鹿（ばか）に相違（そうい）ない。"}
{"en": "I seemed to be able to get through the school somehow, but I would soon give out if this \"curio siege\" kept on long.", "ja": "学校の方はどうかこうか無事に勤まりそうだが、こう骨董責（こっとうぜめ）に逢（あ）ってはとても長く続きそうにない。"}
{"en": "Shortly afterwards, I began to get sick of the school.", "ja": "そのうち学校もいやになった。"}
{"en": "One certain night, while I was strolling about a street named Omachi, I happened to notice a sign of noodles below of which was annotated \"Tokyo\" in the house next to the post office.", "ja": "ある日の晩大町（おおまち）と云う所を散歩していたら郵便局の隣（とな）りに蕎麦（そば）とかいて、下に東京と注を加えた看板があった。"}
{"en": "I am very fond of noodles.", "ja": "おれは蕎麦が大好きである。"}
{"en": "While I was in Tokyo, if I passed by a noodle house and smelled the seasoning spices, I felt uncontrollable temptation to go inside at any cost.", "ja": "東京に居（お）った時でも蕎麦屋の前を通って薬味の香（にお）いをかぐと、どうしても暖簾（のれん）がくぐりたくなった。"}
{"en": "Up to this time I had forgotten the noodle on account of mathematics and antique curios, but since I had seen thus the sign of noodles, I could hardly pass it by unnoticed.", "ja": "今日までは数学と骨董で蕎麦を忘れていたが、こうして看板を見ると素通りが出来なくなる。"}
{"en": "So availing myself of this opportunity, I went in.", "ja": "ついでだから一杯食って行こうと思って上がり込んだ。"}
{"en": "It was not quite up to what I had judged by the sign.", "ja": "見ると看板ほどでもない。"}

{"en": "They did not either know Tokyo or have the means,--I did not know which, but the room was miserably dirty.", "ja": "東京を知らないのか、金がないのか、滅法（めっぽう）きたない。"}

{"en": "Only the price-list, on which was glaringly written \"Noodles\" and which was pasted on the wall, was entirely new.", "ja": "ただ麗々と蕎麦の名前をかいて張り付けたねだん付けだけは全く新しい。"}
